# CS174

An augmented reality (AR) app for Android implementing Teddy (Igarashi 1999), an inflation-based sketch-to-mesh algorithm.

Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) is currently implemented using poly2tri, since it was fast enough to run in real-time.

"Teddy_C++" contains the C++ implementation which uses OpenGL.

"Teddy" contains the materials used for the Android app, which was developed in Unity (the scripts are written in C#.)
